Fishing,"Fishing involves catching fish and other water creatures from oceans, lakes, seas, dams, rivers and ponds for domestic or commercial purposes. In Tanzania, fishing is done in the Indian Ocean and in lakes such as Victoria, Tanganyika, Rukwa and Nyasa. There is also fishing in rivers such as Ruvu, Kilombero and Rufiji. Fishing activities also take place in dams such as Mtera and Nyumba ya Mungu. Major fishing areas in the world are found in Norway, Namibia, Japan and Sweden."
Forestry,"Forestry is a set of practises that involve managing forests for ecological, social and economic purposes. There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests."
Planted forests,"Planted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries. Some examples of planted forests in Tanzania include The Sao Hill forest plantation in Mafinga, Iringa Region and The West Kilimanjaro forest plantation in Kilimanjaro Region."
Natural forests,"Natural forests are the forests that generated themselves naturally. Examples of natural forests include the Eastern Arc (Usambara) Mountains forests, Mdandu (Njombe and Ludewa), Mitarure (Kilwa, Lindi), Kikongoro and Minziro (Misenyi) and The Duru-Haitemba forest (Babati). Other examples of natural forests include The Congo rain-forest found in the Congo basin of the Democratic Republic of Congo and The Amazon forest in Latin America. Natural forests are also found in other countries such as Finland, Sweden, Canada and Russia. Forests offer many benefits to people living close to forested areas and even beyond. For example, charcoal is one of the largest industries in Tanzania, employing tens of thousands of rural people and supplying energy to millions."
